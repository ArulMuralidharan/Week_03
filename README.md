# Week_03


### Requirements
* node version 8.x
* npm version 5.x

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Tutorial
## Setting up your environment
First make a new folder. Inside, create a file called package.json similar to the one in this repository. 

```
{
  "name": "week_03",
  "author": "Aria <arshiam2828@gmail.com>",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

This file uses a json format, meaning there are keys and values. For instance, in the example above the key is "name" and the value is "week_03". This is the name of your project. 


**Metadata**

You can add information about the author and license like I did above, but you can also add other information such as the version number,description, link to the github repository, etc. This defines information about the project.
